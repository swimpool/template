# Chameleon Widget :: Template

> This is a widget for the Android home screen replacement [Chameleon Launcher][1]. To learn more about Chameleon, visit their website at [chameleonlauncher.com][1].

This is the starting point for all (new) Chameleon Launcher widgets developed for WidgetGecko. You may use some or all of this code when writing your own widgets.

The template uses a lot of the scripts and stylesheets from the WidgetGecko [common][2] repository. You can view the repository at [github.com/widgetgecko/common][2] and you are welcome to use the files in your own widgets.
